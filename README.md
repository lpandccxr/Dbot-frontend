# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Please run "npm intall" after pulling from github and "npm run dev" to run the program

# if you are a collaborators of this project

- please run "git clone https://github.com/lpandccxr/Dbot-frontend.git" to make copy to local
- then, please run "npm install" to install the denpendenies in the project folder
- run "git branch -M main", "git checkout -b develop", and "git checkout -b [section]\_[yourName]" to create your own branch, for example, "git checkout -b navbar_Raven". (hint: you should see branch up to date in every step, if not, run "git pull" to pull updates from remote repo)
- please run "git push" to push the changes to your own branch, then run "git merge develop" to create a pull request
